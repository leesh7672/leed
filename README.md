HCL is a Literary Chinese monolingual Dictionary
## word classes
It is very hard to differentiate the word classes in Literary Chinese according to traditional approach.
Therefore, HCL projects adopt a brand new word class system:
> nouns or 名詞,
> verbs or 動詞,
> determiners or 指詞,
> adjectives or 定詞,
> adverbs or 狀詞,
> prepositions or 介詞,
> conjunctions or 連詞,
> aspect-marker or 時態詞,
> light-verbs or 輕動詞,
> interjections or 歎詞.

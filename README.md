# hcl
HCL is a Literary Chinese monolingual Dictionary
## word classes
It is very hard to differentiate the word classes in Literary Chinese according to traditional approach.
Therefore, HCL projects adopt new word class system with nouns(體詞), determiners(指詞), adjectives(定詞),
numerals(數詞), classifiers(量詞), conjunctions(結詞), verbs(動詞), light verbs(輕動詞), prepositions(介詞), tenses(時態詞) and complementizers(成詞).
